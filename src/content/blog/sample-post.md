# Sample Markdown Post

This is a sample post written in **Markdown**. It demonstrates how to use markdown-it to render content in your Svelte blog.

## Features

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists (like this one)
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks

```javascript
// Sample code
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
}
```

## Math Support

Since you're using KaTeX, you can render math equations:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x
$$

Another equation:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{a}^{b} = \frac{b^3 - a^3}{3}
$$

## Images
